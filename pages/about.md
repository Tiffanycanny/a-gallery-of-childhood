## About the Collection
This is a collection of artwork and other artifacts that have been completed by Nora and Evelyn. They completed these projects starting in preschool and continuing now. There are drawings, paintings, collages with paper, a couple of writing pieces and holiday themed artwork. Please enjoy looking at this collection and feeling the joy that the girls felt while creating it.
